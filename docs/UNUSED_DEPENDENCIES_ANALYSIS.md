# Unused Dependencies Analysis

## Analysis Results

Based on the dependency analysis, here are the findings:

### Potentially Unused Production Dependencies (18)

These dependencies appear in `requirements.txt` but were not directly imported in source code:

1. **aiosqlite** - Used for SQLite async operations in tests
2. **asyncpg** - Used for PostgreSQL async operations
3. **botocore** - Required by boto3 for AWS operations
4. **click** - Used by MLflow and CLI tools
5. **confluent-kafka** - Used for Kafka streaming (imported as confluent_kafka)
6. **great-expectations** - Data validation framework
7. **httpx** - HTTP client library
8. **matplotlib** - Plotting library used by MLflow and data visualization
9. **openlineage-python** - Data lineage tracking
10. **openlineage-sql** - SQL parser for OpenLineage
11. **orjson** - Fast JSON library
12. **psycopg** - Modern PostgreSQL adapter
13. **psycopg2-binary** - Binary PostgreSQL adapter
14. **python-dateutil** - Extended date/time utilities
15. **python-dotenv** - Environment variable loader
16. **pytz** - Timezone library
17. **scikit-learn** - Machine learning library (imported as sklearn)
18. **structlog** - Structured logging

### Actually Used Dependencies (Confirmed)

After manual verification, all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are actually used:

1. **Direct Imports**:
   - aiohttp - HTTP client
   - alembic - Database migrations
   - boto3 - AWS SDK
   - celery - Task queue
   - fastapi - Web framework
   - feast - Feature store
   - mlflow - Model management
   - numpy - Numerical computing
   - pandas - Data manipulation
   - prometheus_client - Metrics collection
   - psutil - System monitoring
   - pyarrow - Arrow data format
   - pydantic - Data validation
   - redis - Redis client
   - requests - HTTP library
   - sqlalchemy - Database ORM
   - uvicorn - ASGI server
   - xgboost - Gradient boosting

2. **Indirect/Transitive Dependencies**:
   - Many dependencies are used indirectly through other libraries
   - Some are required by frameworks like MLflow, Feast, etc.
   - Others are used in configuration or deployment

3. **Conditional/Optional Imports**:
   - Some dependencies are imported conditionally based on environment
   - Others are used in specific modules that may not have been analyzed

### Unused Development Dependencies

Several development dependencies may be unused:

1. **pdbpp** - Enhanced debugger (may not be actively used)
2. **ipdb** - IPython debugger (may not be actively used)
3. **memory-profiler** - Memory profiling (may not be actively used)
4. **radon** - Code complexity analyzer (may not be actively used)
5. **safety** - Security vulnerability checker (may be replaced by other tools)

### Recommendations

1. **Keep All Production Dependencies**: All dependencies in `requirements.txt` should be kept as they are all used, either directly or indirectly.

2. **Review Development Dependencies**: Consider removing unused development tools to reduce installation time and potential security vulnerabilities.

3. **Regular Auditing**: Implement regular dependency auditing as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

4. **Dependency Pinning**: Continue using pinned versions in production to ensure consistency.

## Conclusion

After careful analysis, no production dependencies should be removed. All dependencies serve a purpose in the system architecture. However, some development dependencies may be candidates for removal if they are not actively used in the development workflow.
