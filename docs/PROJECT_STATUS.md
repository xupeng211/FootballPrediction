# Project Status

- lifecycle: current-state
- owner: project governance

Last updated: 2026-06-22

## Current baseline

- `main` includes PR #1463 (P0 AI Workflow Gate CI enforcement).
- `main` includes PR #1464 (local CI gatekeeper entrypoint).
- `main` includes PR #1567 (authoritative workflow enforcement dry-run).
- `main` includes PR #1569 (p0_db_write_safety_gate_fix_phase1 — unified guard + 8 scripts).
- `p0_db_write_guard_hardening_production_host_block` hardens the guard: production-like
  DB hosts are now blocked by default (previously warning-only). No production override exists.
- `p0_db_write_safety_gate_fix_phase2` adds guard to 8 more P0 scripts/ops entrypoints.
  Phase1 + Phase2 + Phase3 + Phase4 + Phase5 + Phase7 = 43 scripts now protected. SC-002 remains partial mitigation only.
- Remote GitHub Actions `production-gate.yml` is the final CI authority.
- Local `make ci-local-pr` is a pre-push helper, not a full replacement for remote CI.
- AI workflow governance rules are enforced by:
  - `scripts/ops/ai_workflow_gate.py` (CI-enforced workflow and documentation checks)
  - `scripts/devops/gatekeeper.sh` (CI-enforced, multi-phase)
  - `scripts/ops/documentation_governance_check.py` (standalone checker)
  - `.github/pull_request_template.md` (mandatory PR structure)
  - `docs/CODEX_WORKFLOW.md` (Codex task rules)
  - `docs/DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE.md` (doc lifecycle rules)

## Current SC-002 status (DB write safety gate)

- SC-002 is **not fully fixed**. This remains partial mitigation only.
- A unified guard helper (`scripts/ops/helpers/db_write_guard.js`) has been added.
- Production-like DB host (RDS, Cloud SQL, Supabase, etc.) is hard blocked by default.
  No production override exists. No `ALLOW_PRODUCTION_DB_WRITE` bypass variable exists.
- `p0_db_write_safety_gate_fix_phase1` (#1569): 8 scripts integrated.
- `p0_db_write_guard_hardening_production_host_block` (#1570): production host hard block.
- `p0_db_write_safety_gate_fix_phase2` (#1571): 8 more scripts integrated.
- `db_write_guard_static_enforcement_dry_run` (#1572): static scanner deployed.
- `p0_db_write_safety_gate_fix_phase3` (#1573): 8 more scripts integrated.
- `db_write_guard_static_enforcement_fix_phase1` (#1575): advisory warning in
  ai_workflow_gate.py for new/modified unguarded scripts/ops JS files.
- `p0_db_write_safety_gate_fix_phase4` (#1576): 6 more scripts integrated.
- `p0_db_write_safety_gate_fix_phase5` (#1579): 7 more scripts integrated.
- `p0_db_write_safety_gate_fix_phase6` (#1580): 5 more scripts integrated.
- `p0_db_write_safety_gate_fix_phase7` (#1582): 1 script integrated.
- **Phase1 + Phase2 + Phase3 + Phase4 + Phase5 + Phase6 + Phase7 = 43 of 66 P0 scripts now guarded.**
- **db_write_guard_static_enforcement_fix_phase2** (#1583): changed-files enforcement
  upgraded from advisory to hard fail in ai_workflow_gate.py. New/modified unguarded
  scripts/ops JS files now cause CI failure. Historical full-scan candidates are
  explicitly categorized (NOT fixed) and exempt from hard fail.
- **sc002_closure_plan_phase0** (#1584): SC-002 closure plan documented in
  `docs/SC002_CLOSURE_PLAN.md`. This is the authoritative SC-002 status reference.
  SC-002 remains partial mitigation only. 43/66 guarded. 22 categorized, not fixed.
  21 additional browser/Playwright scripts identified as skipped_complex (total 43).
  Training, data expansion, and real DB write remain blocked.
- **specialized_browser_fotmob_pageprops_audit_phase1** (this PR): Static audit of all
  43 skipped_complex scripts completed. See `docs/SC002_BROWSER_FOTMOB_PAGEPROPS_AUDIT.md`.
  Key findings: 20 confirmed DB write paths, 14 read-only/no-DB, 4 need manual review,
  3 shared modules, 1 scraper/browser only, 1 possible indirect write.
  The gap is now precisely characterized: 28 scripts need guard/exclusion action.
  SC-002 remains partial mitigation only.
- Remaining 22 complex candidates categorized into:
  - `pageprops_pipeline` (9): pageProps/FotMob pipeline scripts
  - `fotmob_pipeline` (2): FotMob ingestion scripts
  - `shared_module` (3): shared helper modules consumed by entrypoints
  - `dry_run_or_audit` (8): dry-run, audit, preflight scripts
  - Plus 21 browser/Playwright scripts previously classified as `skipped_complex`
- Each remaining candidate has: explicit category, reason, reviewed_at, future_action.
  These are NOT counted as "guarded" and SC-002 is NOT "fully fixed".
- DB write safety status: **blocked / partial phase1-7 guards added**.
- Guard remains opt-in per script for historical files. New scripts touching
  `scripts/ops/` with DB write risk MUST integrate the guard or be explicitly
  allowlisted — enforced via CI hard fail on changed-files.
- Training and data expansion remain blocked.
- No real DB write is authorized.
- Changed-files hard fail scope: **scripts/ops/\*\*/\*.js only**. Python, SQL, and
  migration enforcement is not yet designed.

## Current operating rules

- One task / one branch / one PR.
- Do not work directly on `main`.
- Do not mix governance changes with runtime business code (CI-enforced).
- Do not start automatically. Recommended next task only after user confirmation (CI-enforced).
- PR body must include all mandatory sections: Scope, Documentation Impact, Safety Impact,
  Validation, CI Gate Scope, No-deletion/move/rename confirmation, Rollback Plan,
  Next Recommended Task.
- CI Gate Scope must state what validation proves and does not prove.
- If a PR adds or modifies `docs/_reports/*.md`, it must update an
  authoritative doc or give a concrete source-of-truth no-update reason in the
  PR body.

## Current allowed work

- Small docs-only source-of-truth updates (like this file).
- Read-only audits.
- Small, scoped CI/governance fixes that do not touch runtime code.
- SC-002 closure planning, governance, and documentation tasks.
- Future FotMob/data work only after explicit user confirmation and under
  read-only/no-write constraints.

## Current blocked work

- DB write and schema migration.
- Raw data write (`raw_match_data`).
- Real scraper and browser automation.
- Large archive moves (delete/move/rename of historical files).
- Automatic next-task execution.
- Mixed governance + business-code PRs.
- Implementation PRs that substitute reports/manifests/tests for runtime behavior change.
- Consecutive governance-only PRs without explicit human confirmation.
- Formal model training.
- Data expansion / large-scale raw acquisition.

## Current source-of-truth docs

| Doc | Status |
|---|---|
| `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` | active (this file) |
| `docs/DATA_SOURCE_STRATEGY.md` | active (created alongside this file) |
| `docs/CODEX_WORKFLOW.md` | active |
| `docs/DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE.md` | active |
| `docs/data/FOTMOB_CURRENT_STATE.md` | active — read for FotMob state |
| `docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` | active |
| `docs/SC002_CLOSURE_PLAN.md` | active — authoritative SC-002 status reference |
| `docs/SC002_BROWSER_FOTMOB_PAGEPROPS_AUDIT.md` | active — static audit of all 43 skipped_complex scripts |
| `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` | active — needs provenance review |
| `docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_AUDIT_REPORT.md` | evidence/needs_update — stale CI references |

## Current technical debt posture

- `docs/_reports/` contains 434 historical report files as of the
  authoritative workflow enforcement dry-run.
- `docs/_manifests/` contains 171 historical manifest files.
- These are archived evidence; they should not be read as current truth.
- Bulk archive moves are planned but not yet executed.
- Stale docs (`GITHUB_ACTIONS_AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `TESTING_GUIDE.md`) should be
  reviewed and marked or superseded in small scoped PRs.
- Technical debt remains high enough to block data expansion and formal
  training. Current P0 debt includes DB write safety, cutoff strategy, training
  eligibility, and schema/init alignment.

## Current training and expansion posture

- Minimal training loop: connected for smoke-level validation only.
- Formal training: blocked.
- Formal cohort candidates / smoke-level candidates: 58.
- Formal candidates with odds: 0.
- Formal training must not start until eligibility, odds, cutoff-time policy,
  and DB write safety blockers are resolved.
- Data expansion: blocked by P0 technical debt and raw/write governance.
- DB write safety: blocked / partial phase1+phase2+phase3+phase4+phase5+phase6 guards added. The P0 DB
  write safety dry-run found 122 production DB-write risk files, including 66 P0
  files and 110 files with no safety gate. Phase1+Phase2+Phase3+Phase4+Phase5+Phase7 = 43 scripts/ops
  now guarded (Phase1+Phase2+Phase3+Phase4+Phase5+Phase7 = 43/66). A static enforcement dry-run scanner
  has been added to audit remaining coverage. SC-002 is partially mitigated, NOT
  fully fixed. Remaining scripts need Phase8+ or static enforcement.
- Authoritative document backflow: fix phase1 starts enforcement through the PR
  template, AI Workflow Gate, Documentation Governance, Codex Workflow, and this
  current-state update.

## Recent dry-run conclusions now reflected here

| Dry-run | Current conclusion |
|---|---|
| `formal_training_cohort_inventory_dry_run` | Formal training remains blocked; only 58 smoke-level candidates were found and formal candidates with odds = 0. |
| `technical_debt_workflow_audit_dry_run` | P0 technical debt blocks data expansion and formal training; priority debt is DB write safety, cutoff strategy, training eligibility, and schema/init alignment. |
| `p0_db_write_safety_gate_dry_run` | DB write safety remains blocked; 122 production DB-write risk files were found, P0 = 66, 110 lack gates, SC-002 remains unfixed. |
| `authoritative_workflow_enforcement_dry_run` | The project already has authoritative docs, but `_reports` has overgrown and AI agents were not forced to maintain current-state docs. |

## Current FotMob status

- FotMob data ingestion is blocked. See `docs/data/FOTMOB_CURRENT_STATE.md` for details.
- `raw_write_ready_count` is 0.
  **(Superseded 2026-06-11: retained raw storage has moved forward. 4 real FotMob raw
  payloads exist in `raw_match_data` with `data_version=fotmob_live_v1`, audited
  4/4 parseable, sha valid, inner matchId ok, 0 errors, 0 warnings. See
  `docs/data/FOTMOB_RETAINED_RAW_STAGE_STATUS.md`.)**
- No DB write, raw write, browser automation, or network data collection is authorized.
  **(Partial exception: the 4 retained raw rows above were written under explicit
  authorization in #1485 and #1486.)**
- Parser, schema, fixture, and validation assets from #1454 are safe to reuse as
  offline references only.

## Next recommended sequence

1. SC-002 closure plan phase0 completed. See `docs/SC002_CLOSURE_PLAN.md` for the
   authoritative SC-002 status, closure criteria, release gates, and recommended
   next tasks.
2. Phase1-7 = 43 scripts/ops entrypoints now guarded (~65% of P0).
3. Static enforcement dry-run scanner deployed for coverage auditing.
4. Changed-files hard fail enabled for new/modified unguarded scripts/ops JS files.
   Remaining 43 complex candidates categorized (22 in allowlist + 21 browser, NOT fixed).
   SC-002 remains partial mitigation only.
5. Next recommended tasks (in priority order, after audit):
   - `confirmed_write_path_guard_phase` — integrate guard into 20 confirmed-write-path
     scripts (high-risk browser+DB scripts first: `odds_sniper.js`,
     `fixture_harvester_l1.js`)
   - `shared_module_db_write_boundary_design_phase1` — design boundary enforcement for
     3 shared modules and map all consumer entrypoints
   - `sc002_allowlist_cleanup_phase1` — update allowlist to reflect audit findings;
     move 14 verified-read-only scripts out of skipped_complex
   - `manual_review_phase1` — manually review 4 `needs_manual_review` scripts by
     tracing execution paths through helper modules
   - `scraper_browser_execution_policy_phase1` — define browser automation execution
     policy for the 2 high-risk browser+DB scripts
   - `python_sql_migration_enforcement_design_phase1` — design enforcement for Python
     and SQL migration paths
   - `runtime_db_role_permission_review_phase1` — review DB-level role/permission model
   - `sc002_release_gate_checklist_phase1` — create detailed per-gate verification
     checklists
6. Keep formal training and data expansion blocked until DB write safety resolved
   and release gate criteria met.
7. Do not start model training, data expansion, raw-write work, scraper/browser
   automation, or Phase8+ guard integration automatically.
8. Do not start automatically. Recommended next task only after user confirmation.
