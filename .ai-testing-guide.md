# AI Programming Tool Testing Guide

## ⚠️ Critical Warning for AI Tools

**DO NOT RUN**: `pytest tests/unit/api/test_xxx.py --cov=src` on individual files!

This will produce misleading 0% coverage reports due to mock usage.

## ✅ Correct Testing Commands

Always use these commands:

```bash
# Phase 1 Core Tests (RECOMMENDED)
make test-phase1

# Quick unit tests (no coverage)
make test-quick

# Full test suite with coverage
make coverage

# Run specific test files WITHOUT coverage
pytest tests/unit/api/test_health.py -v
```

## 🔍 Why Single-File Coverage Fails

When running individual test files with `--cov=src`:
- Tests use mocks (not real imports)
- Coverage tool sees no actual code execution
- Reports 0% coverage (misleading)

## 📋 Phase 1 Test Files

- `tests/unit/api/test_data.py` (17 tests, 90% coverage)
- `tests/unit/api/test_features.py` (28 tests, 88% coverage)
- `tests/unit/api/test_predictions.py` (27 tests, 88% coverage)

## 🎯 AI Tool Integration

If you're an AI programming assistant:
1. Always prefer `make test-phase1` for testing API modules
2. Use `make test-quick` for rapid validation
3. Never add `--cov=src` to single-file test commands
4. Check TEST_RUN_GUIDE.md for detailed explanations
