# Qwen Code - Football Prediction Project

## Project Overview

The Football Prediction project is an enterprise-level football match result prediction system built with modern Python technologies. It's built on FastAPI and incorporates a comprehensive development infrastructure with best practices for code quality, testing, and deployment.

**Key Technologies:**
- **Web Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
- **Caching:** Redis
- **ML Framework:** Custom machine learning components
- **Containerization:** Docker + docker-compose
- **Testing:** pytest with extensive coverage
- **Code Quality:** ruff, mypy, black, pre-commit hooks

**Project Maturity:** Production-ready with continuous improvement methodology.

## Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Docker and docker-compose
- Make

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xupeng211/FootballPrediction.git
   cd FootballPrediction
   ```

2. **Initialize environment:**
   ```bash
   make install      # Install dependencies
   make dev-setup    # Complete development setup
   make context      # Load project context
   ```

3. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   make test         # Run all tests
   make coverage     # Run tests with coverage report
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   # Using Make (recommended):
   make up           # Start with docker-compose
   
   # Or directly with Python:
   python -m src.main
   ```

### Development Commands

- `make help` - Show all available commands
- `make install` - Install dependencies
- `make lint` - Run code quality checks
- `make test` - Run all tests
- `make coverage` - Run tests with coverage
- `make ci` - Run local CI simulation
- `make sync-issues` - Sync GitHub issues
- `make prepush` - Run pre-push quality gate

### Docker Commands

- `make up` - Start services with docker-compose
- `make down` - Stop services
- `make logs` - View service logs
- `make build` - Build Docker image

## Testing

The project has extensive test coverage with 385+ passing tests achieving ~96.35% coverage:

- **Unit tests** - Testing individual functions and classes
- **Integration tests** - Testing component interactions
- **API tests** - Testing HTTP endpoints
- **End-to-end tests** - Full user flow validation
- **Performance tests** - Benchmarking and load testing

### Test Commands

- `make test` - Run all tests
- `make test-unit` - Run unit tests only
- `make test-phase1` - Run core API tests
- `make coverage-fast` - Run fast coverage tests
- `make test-containers` - Run tests with TestContainers

## Development Conventions

### Code Quality
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines (enforced by ruff)
- Type annotations required (enforced by mypy)
- Pre-commit hooks run on every commit
- Test coverage threshold of 80% for CI

### Git Workflow
- Use feature branches for new functionality
- Run `make prepush` before pushing changes
- Follow conventional commit messages
- Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality

### Documentation
- Code should be self-documenting with clear function names
- API endpoints have OpenAPI documentation
- Configuration options are documented

### Architecture Principles
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use design patterns where appropriate (Repository, CQRS, Observer, etc.)
- Separate domain logic from infrastructure concerns
- Implement proper error handling and logging

## Infrastructure and Services

- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Alembic for migrations
- **Cache:** Redis for caching and session storage
- **API Gateway:** Nginx reverse proxy
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus metrics collection
- **Security:** JWT authentication, rate limiting, input validation
- **Background Tasks:** Celery for async job processing

## Project Reports and Status

The project includes comprehensive documentation of its status:
